---SUMMARY---
I fixed the issue by:

1. Fixing the misleading comment on the `divide()` method that incorrectly stated "Divide numbers without any error handling" when it actually already had error handling for division by zero.
2. Adding proper error handling in the `calc()` method when the operation is division. This ensures that division by zero is caught and handled properly when using the `calc()` method.
3. Improving the variable naming in the `calc()` method for better readability, replacing `x`, `y`, and `z` with more descriptive `num1`, `num2`, and `operation`.
4. Adding a catch-all error for unknown operations.

The changes maintain the existing functionality while ensuring division by zero is properly handled throughout the calculator class.
