- Automatically analyze issues and create fix PRs
- Provide rich context about PRs and issues to Claude
- Simple setup with minimal configuration
- Uses GitHub CLI and Claude Code CLI for reliability

## Quick Start

### 1. Add Claude to Your Repository

Create a workflow file to integrate Claude with your repository:

**File: `.github/workflows/claude-code.yml`**
```yaml
name: Claude Code Integration

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  claude-integration:
    uses: basicmachines-co/claude-code-github-action/.github/workflows/claude-full.yml@v0.10.0
    with:
      issue-label: 'claude-fix'  # Optional: customize the trigger label
    secrets:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

**File: `.github/workflows/claude-issue-fix.yml`**
```yaml
name: Claude Code Issue Fix

on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]

jobs:
  claude-label-fix:
    uses: basicmachines-co/claude-code-github-action/.github/workflows/claude-label-fix.yml@v0.10.0
    with:
      issue-label: 'claude-fix'  # Must match your chosen label
    secrets:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

### 2. Use Claude in PRs and Issues

Comment on a pull request:
- `claude: Explain the changes in this PR` → Get analysis and feedback
- `claude-suggest: Improve error handling` → Get code suggestions

Or use in-line code review:
- Comment on a specific line with `claude: What's wrong here?` → Get targeted analysis
- Comment on a specific line with `claude-suggest: Fix this` → Get targeted fix suggestions

Comment on an issue:
- `claude: What's causing this bug?` → Get analysis without changing code
- `claude-fix: Fix this by adding error handling` → Get a fix PR created automatically

Or add a label:
- Add the `claude-fix` label to an issue → Get a fix PR created automatically

## Setup Details

The Quick Start section above shows the minimal configuration needed. Our action uses reusable workflows to make setup easy - you just need to create two small workflow files that reference our pre-configured workflows.

## Understanding Claude Code Modes

Claude Code can operate in several different modes, each with specific behaviors:

| Mode | Triggered By | Works On | Description |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| `review` | `claude:` comment | PRs | Analyzes PR changes and responds with comments |
| `suggest` | `claude-suggest:` comment | PRs | Suggests code changes in PR comments |
| `suggest-review` | `claude-suggest:` code review comment | PR code line | Suggests in-line code changes that can be applied with one click |
| `issue-analyze` | `claude:` comment | Issues | Analyzes issues and responds with insights |
| `issue-fix` | `claude-fix:` comment or label | Issues | Creates a PR with code changes to fix the issue |
| `direct` | Direct action invocation | N/A | Runs Claude on arbitrary input and saves response to a file |

## Advanced Configuration

The reusable workflows support several configuration options:

### Comment-Based Integration (`claude-full.yml`)

```yaml
jobs:
  claude-integration:
    uses: basicmachines-co/claude-code-github-action/.github/workflows/claude-full.yml@v0.10.0
    with:
      # All parameters are optional with sensible defaults
      issue-label: 'claude-fix'    # Label that triggers issue fixes
      branch-prefix: 'fix'         # Prefix for branches created by fixes
      require-org-membership: true # Only process issues from org members
      organization: 'my-org'       # Organization to check membership against
      debug-mode: false            # Enable verbose logging
      strict-mode: true            # When false, allows Claude to add improvements
    secrets:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
      PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}  # Optional: For commit attribution
```

### Label-Based Integration (`claude-label-fix.yml`)

```yaml
jobs:
  claude-label-fix:
    uses: basicmachines-co/claude-code-github-action/.github/workflows/claude-label-fix.yml@v0.10.0
    with:
      # All parameters are optional with sensible defaults
      issue-label: 'claude-fix'    # Must match the label you're using
      branch-prefix: 'fix'         # Prefix for branches created by fixes
      require-org-membership: true # Only process issues from org members
      organization: 'my-org'       # Organization to check membership against
      debug-mode: false            # Enable verbose logging
    secrets:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
      PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}  # Optional: For commit attribution
```

Only repo maintainers with write access can add labels, providing security control over which issues Claude will fix.

## Query Prefixes and Their Behaviors

| Query Format | Where It Works | What It Does |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| `claude: <query>` | PR comments | Analyzes PR changes and responds as a comment |
| `claude-suggest: <query>` | PR comments | Suggests code changes in PR comments |
| `claude: <query>` | PR code review comments | Analyzes specific lines of code and responds as a comment |
| `claude-suggest: <query>` | PR code review comments | Creates in-line suggested changes |
| `claude: <query>` | Issue comments | Analyzes the issue and responds as a comment |
| `claude-fix: <query>` | Issue comments | Creates a PR with code changes to fix the issue |
| Adding the `claude-fix` label | Issues | Creates a PR with code changes to fix the issue |

## Configuration Options

When using our reusable workflows, you only need to configure a few key options:

| Parameter | Description | Default | Used In |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `issue-label` | Label that triggers issue fixes | `claude-fix` | Both workflows |
| `branch-prefix` | Prefix for branches created by fixes | `fix` | Both workflows |
| `require-org-membership` | Require the comment author to be a public member of the organization | `true` | Both workflows |
| `organization` | Organization name to check membership against | Repository owner | Both workflows |
| `personal-access-token` | Token for commits to override the default GitHub token | None | Both workflows |
| `debug-mode` | Enable verbose logging | `false` | Both workflows |
| `strict-mode` | Controls whether Claude adds improvements beyond what's requested | `true` | Comment workflow only |

All parameters are optional and have sensible defaults.

## Enhanced Context for Claude

With version 0.10.0, Claude receives complete context for your PRs and issues, including:

- PR metadata (title, description, branch info)
- Issue details (title, description, labels)
- List of all files changed in PRs
- Complete diff of all changes in PRs
- Repository information (name, description, languages)
- Full repository checkout for improved code understanding and analysis
- User feedback with specific instructions

## Example Queries

### PR Comments

- `claude: Explain the changes in this PR`
- `claude: Suggest improvements for the code quality`
- `claude: Identify potential security issues`
- `claude: Is this implementation optimal?`
- `claude-suggest: Refactor this code to be more maintainable`
- `claude-suggest: Add error handling for edge cases`

### PR Code Review Comments

- `claude: What's the purpose of this function?`
- `claude: Is there a potential bug here?`
- `claude-suggest: Fix this loop to handle empty arrays`
- `claude-suggest: Optimize this database query`

### Issue Comments

- `claude: What might be causing this bug?`
- `claude: Analyze this error log and suggest potential fixes`
- `claude: How would you implement this feature?`
- `claude-fix: Implement proper error handling for division by zero`
- `claude-fix: Fix the memory leak in the connection pool`

## Permissions

Ensure your workflow has the appropriate permissions for each mode:

```yaml
# For review and suggest modes
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write

# For issue-fix mode
permissions:
  contents: write  # Needed to create branches
  pull-requests: write  # Needed to create PRs
  issues: write  # Needed to comment on issues
```

## Security Considerations

- Only users with appropriate GitHub permissions can trigger Claude Code actions
- For issue fixes, using the label-based approach gives you more control over who can trigger code changes
- The `strict-mode` parameter limits Claude to only making requested changes
- The `require-org-membership` option ensures only organization members can use Claude for issues
- Using a personal access token for commits ensures proper attribution and bypasses CLA requirements

### Organization Membership Visibility Requirement

When using `require-org-membership: true` (which is the default), the GitHub user who triggers Claude (by commenting with `claude:` or `claude-fix:`) must be a **public** member of the organization.

**Important:** By default, GitHub organization memberships are private, which means the API cannot verify your membership. To make your membership public:

1. **Go to your organization page**: `https://github.com/your-organization-name`
2. **Click on the "People" tab**
3. **Find your username** in the member list
4. **Click on the "Private" dropdown** next to your name
5. **Select "Make public"**

Alternatively, you can do this from your profile:
1. Go to your GitHub profile
2. Click on "Organizations" in the left sidebar
3. Find the organization in the list
4. Click the "Make public" button

This allows the GitHub API to verify your organization membership when you use Claude Code action.
